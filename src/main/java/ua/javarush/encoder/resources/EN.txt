Gareth Southgate on including defensive midfielder Kalvin Phillips, who is yet to play for Manchester City this season: "Giving some less experienced players in the squad. Tyrone Mings is out for the season, John Stones is out for this camp. Conor Coady is out playing in the Championship now.

"Declan Rice was the only English player at the weekend to play in a single pivot. Kalvin is the next best option."

On Harry Maguire's inclusion, despite not playing for Manchester United: "It's not a good situation that those guys aren't playing football, but in some areas we have depth. In others we don't."
